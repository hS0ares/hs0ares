## Hi there ðŸ‘‹
-ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working as Salesforce Developer, where I was involved in the design, development, and deployment of Salesforce components using Aura and LWC. I also handled general configuration of the Salesforce Org and automated tools. My role required working closely with agile methodologies, particularly SCRUM and Kanban, to ensure dynamic delivery and continuous improvement. Additionally, I managed integrations using SOAP, REST, and GraphQL APIs, and supported both the functional team and technical leaders with development and QA.
